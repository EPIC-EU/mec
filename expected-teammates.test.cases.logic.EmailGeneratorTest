<p>Hi Instr,</p>

<p>
  A warm welcome as a student, participator or assessor  at the Measuring Epic Capabilities (MEC)-toolkit. With this toolkit youâ€™ll be able to set your own targets as a group, create milestones and have the targets assessed, within the EPIC-project. The EPIC-project helps you to improve employability through internationalization and multidisciplinary collaboration. <br>
  We have created an account for you.
